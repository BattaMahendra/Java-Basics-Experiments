How does Array list grows in size ?

1. When ever you initialize the default capacity of array list  is 10.
2. The default load factor is 0.75
3. ArrayList changes its capacity based on the calculation of threshold
4. Threshold = (Load Factor) * (Current Capacity) ==> 0.75 X 10 = 7(approximately)
5. So when the 7 elements gets filled in the array list its threshold is reached and it increases
    size based on following formula
    new capacity = old capacity + (old capacity >> 1)
                 = 10 + (5)
                 = 15
                 15 will be the new capcity of array list
