1. TreeMap is slower for insertion, retrieval, and deletion compared to HashMap and LinkedHashMap because of its logarithmic time complexity.
2. TreeMap guarantees a sorted order of its elements based on the keys, which HashMap and LinkedHashMap do not.
3. HashMap and LinkedHashMap are generally faster for most operations, especially in scenarios with a large number of elements,
   but they do not guarantee any specific order.


TreeMap vs LInkedHashMap vs HashMap vs HashTable

TreeMap:

Data Structure: Implemented as a red-black tree.
Ordering: Maintains elements sorted based on keys (natural order or custom comparator).
Performance: Logarithmic time complexity for most operations.
Nulls: Doesn't allow null keys, but allows null values if the comparator supports them.
Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where elements need to be stored in a sorted order based on keys.
LinkedHashMap:

Data Structure: Combines a hash table with a doubly-linked list.
Ordering: Maintains insertion order of elements.
Performance: Similar to HashMap for most operations, but slightly slower due to maintaining insertion order.
Nulls: Allows both null keys and values.
Use Case: Suitable when maintaining insertion order is required, like LRU caches.


HashMap:

Data Structure: Utilizes a hash table for storing key-value pairs.
Ordering: Doesn't maintain any order of elements.
Performance: Generally provides constant time complexity for most operations (average-case), but can degrade to O(n) in worst-case scenarios.
Nulls: Allows both null keys and values.
Use Case: Preferred for general-purpose use cases where fast access and no specific order are required.

HashTable:

Data Structure: Utilizes a hash table for storing key-value pairs.
Ordering: Doesn't maintain any order of elements.
Performance: Similar to HashMap, but synchronized, leading to slower performance in multi-threaded environments.
Nulls: Doesn't allow null keys or values.
Use Case: Deprecated in favor of ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations. Previously used in legacy codebases where thread safety was required.


Summary:
In summary, the choice among these implementations depends on specific requirements:

Use TreeMap when elements need to be sorted based on keys.
Use LinkedHashMap when maintaining insertion order is important.
Use HashMap for general-purpose use cases with no specific order requirements and fast access.
Use HashTable only in legacy codebases where thread safety is required, preferring ConcurrentHashMap for new developments.
