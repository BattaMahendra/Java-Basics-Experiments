/**
 *  Generics were introduced to avoid run time exceptions caused due to typecasting errors.
 *
 *  Generics are the symbols <> + Object type in <>
 *  they enforce type safety while writing the code
 *  Generics are a compile-time feature - They help you write safer code, but disappear at runtime. They don't
 *  matter for JVM. For eg: if we have two variables of list
 *      List<String> StringList = new ArrayList<>(); // compiled as List stringList = new ArrayList();
 *      List<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>(); // compiled as List integerList = new ArrayList();
 *
 *      Which means at run time JVM removes all generics. you can check that for yourself with following code
 *      System.out.println(stringList.getClass().getName() == integerList.getClass().getName()); // prints true
 *
 *     The above process is called type erasure ( which means the generic type is erased at runtime by JVM)
 *     It only exists at compile time to help you write better code. Once code compiles , types are erased
 *
 *     Because of type erasure
 *          1. We can't have static data members of Generic i.e private static T t; (not possible)
 *          2. We can't create generic exceptions ( because at run time , the type is erased)

 * Common interview-style questions / exercises

 Explain type erasure ‚Äî what gets erased and what the runtime sees.

 Why is List<Integer> not a subtype of List<Number>?
    Ans
        List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Number> numList = intList;  // Suppose this was allowed

        numList.add(3.14); // double is a Number, so allowed!

        // But now intList contains a Double, not an Integer! ‚ùå Type safety broken
        Integer x = intList.get(0); // ClassCastException at runtime


 Explain and give examples of ? extends T and ? super T.

 Why can't you create new T[]?

 What are raw types and why are they dangerous?

 Demonstrate a generic method that swaps elements in an array.

 Explain why you cannot create a generic exception class MyException<T> extends Exception.

        üìù Interview-Ready Answer

        1. You cannot create a generic exception class (MyException<T> extends Exception) because:
        2. type erasure removes generic type info at runtime.
        3. The JVM would not be able to distinguish between MyException<String> and MyException<Integer> in a catch block.
                MyException<String> and MyException<Integer> would both just be MyException at runtime.
        4. This breaks compile-time type checking of exceptions, so Java forbids it.
