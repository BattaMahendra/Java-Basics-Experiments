         *
         * Implements interfaces List , Dequeue ( which internally implements Queue)
         * thus linkedList have properties of List and as well Dequeue
         *
         * 1. Internally uses doubly linked list
         * 2. It implements both List and Dequeue Interfaces unlike arraylist
         * 3. Preferred for frequent insertions and deletions
         * 4. Traversal and random access is slow compared to ArrayList (To access an element, we need to iterate from the beginning to the element.)
         * 5. More memory overhead as linkedlist contains nodes ( each node stores data + 2 references: prev and next)
         *      Arraylist is better as it internally uses array which stores elements in contiguous memory locations
         *
