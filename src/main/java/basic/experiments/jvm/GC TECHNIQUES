                        🧠 GARBAGE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES IN JAVA

🟢 Serial GC

    Meaning:
        Single-threaded garbage collection with Stop-The-World pauses

    How it works:
        🧹 One GC thread cleans Young and Old generations

    Where used:
        🖥️ Small apps, low-memory systems

    Pros:
        ✅ Simple, low overhead

    Cons:
        ❌ Long pauses

    JVM option:
        -XX:+UseSerialGC



🔵 Parallel GC (Throughput GC)

    Meaning:
        Multi-threaded GC focused on maximum throughput

    How it works:
        ⚙️ Multiple GC threads, full Stop-The-World

    Where used:
        🏭 Batch jobs, CPU-heavy workloads

    Pros:
        🚀 High throughput

    Cons:
        ❌ Long pause times

    Default GC:
        Java 7, Java 8

    JVM option:
        -XX:+UseParallelGC



🟠 CMS GC (Deprecated)

        Meaning:
            Low-pause GC using concurrent marking

        How it works:
            ⏳ Most GC runs alongside the app

        Pros:
            ⏱️ Shorter pauses than Parallel GC

        Cons:
            ❌ Fragmentation, deprecated

        Status:
            🚫 Deprecated (Java 9), Removed (Java 14)



🟣 G1 GC ⭐ (Most Common)

      Meaning:
        Region-based GC designed for large heaps and predictable pause times.

      How it works:
          • Heap divided into small regions
          • Collects regions with most garbage first
          • Mixes Young + Old collection
          • Concurrent marking

      Where it is used:
          • Spring Boot microservices
          • Large heap production systems
          • General-purpose server apps

      Pros:
          • Predictable pause times
          • Good balance of throughput and latency
          • Default GC from Java 9+

      Cons:
        • Slightly more CPU overhead than Parallel GC

      Default GC:
          • Java 9+
          • Java 11
          • Java 17
          • Java 21

      JVM option:
        -XX:+UseG1GC


🟡 ZGC

        Meaning:
            Ultra-low latency garbage collector

        How it works:
            🎯 Concurrent GC with pauses usually <10ms

        Where used:
            💹 Real-time and very large heap systems

        Pros:
            ⚡ Extremely low pauses

        Cons:
            ❌ Higher CPU usage

        JVM option:
            -XX:+UseZGC



🔴 Shenandoah GC

        Meaning:
            Low-latency GC developed by Red Hat

        How it works:
            🔄 Concurrent compaction and cleanup

        Where used:
            🧪 Latency-sensitive systems

        Pros:
            🧘 Minimal pause times

        JVM option:
            -XX:+UseShenandoahGC


📌 QUICK MEMORY HOOK

        Serial GC → Simple, slow, single-threaded
        Parallel GC → Fast throughput, long pauses
        CMS GC → Deprecated, avoid
        G1GC → Balanced, production default ⭐
        ZGC → Ultra-low latency, modern systems
        Shenandoah → Low latency, Red Hat ecosystem
