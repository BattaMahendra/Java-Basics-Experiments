                                    🧭 3️⃣ PC REGISTER (PROGRAM COUNTER)

This one is tiny but crucial.

    What it is:
        A small register that stores the address of the current JVM instruction

    Why it exists:
        CPU executes one instruction at a time
        JVM must remember where it left off


🧠 PC REGISTER RULES

    • One PC Register per thread
    • Updated after every instruction
    • Points to bytecode instruction, not source code

    Native methods:
        PC Register = undefined

🎯 SIMPLE EXECUTION EXAMPLE

        int x = 10;
        int y = x + 5;

        PC Register:
            👉 points to instruction: load x
            👉 then add 5
            👉 then store y

        Without PC Register:
            CPU would have amnesia
