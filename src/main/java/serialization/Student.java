    Basics & Why

        What is Serialization / Deserialization

            Serialization: converting an object graph into a byte stream (so it can be stored or sent).
                1. So that we can transfer the object over a network
                2. To Store object into DB or save in file

            Deserialization: reconstructing objects back from that byte stream.



    Typical APIs: ObjectOutputStream / ObjectInputStream.

    When to use

         Persisting objects to disk, sending objects over network (RMI, cached state), or implementing deep cloning

/**
 * Why do we need Serialization and Deserialization
 *
 *  👉 Without serialization:
 *
 *      🔸 Objects live only in memory
 *      🔸 JVM shutdown = object lost
 *
 *  👉 With serialization:
 *
 *      🔸 Object can outlive the JVM
 *      🔸 Object can move between JVMs

    /*
    * The final modifier makes no difference when it has literal initialization.
    * When a variable of type String is declared as final and transient,
    *  its value is determined at compile-time and is stored in the class’s constant pool.
    *  Since it is final, it’s value can’t be changed after its initialization.
    * Hence, its value will be taken from the class and not null.

    //experimenting transient with final keyword when variable is declared

    private Teacher teacher;  // an externalizable object

    //non serialized object
    //private Department department; // results in runtime error as Department is not a serializable object.

/*
* Important topics to address
* 1. What is externalization ( how it is helpful as alternative of serialization)
* 2. Serialization on Enums ( they follow different mechanisms compared to serialization)
* 3. What is readResolve() method is useful ?
* 4. How to customize serialization ? ( writeObject( ObjectOutputStream ) and readObject(ObjectInputStream) methods)
* 5. How is inheritance possible in serializable parent or serializable child ?
* 6. What happens if a serializable class contains non-serializable object reference ? ( how to handle it )
*     ans.  ❌ Throws java.io.NotSerializableException
*           how to handle it
*           Three ways
*           1. Mark that field as transient
*           2. handle in  customization i.e use writeObject() and readObject() methods
*           3. Make that object class serializable
