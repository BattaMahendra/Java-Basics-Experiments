/**
 *
 * 3. Why is String Immutable? (Interview Gold ✨)
 *
 * There are multiple reasons:
 *
 * 1. Security
 *
 *              Strings are used in many sensitive areas:
 *              file paths (new File("C:/data/file.txt"))
 *              network connections (Socket("localhost"))
 *              database URLs, usernames, passwords
 *              If strings were mutable, a hacker could change "jdbc:mysql://localhost" to "jdbc:hacked://evil".
 *
 * 2. Caching / String Pool
 *
 *      Java maintains a String Constant Pool (SCP).
 *      If strings were mutable, "abc" could suddenly change to "xyz", breaking all cached references.
 *
 * 3. Thread-safety
 *
 *      Since strings cannot be changed, multiple threads can share the same String object without synchronization.
 *
 * 4. Hashing Performance
 *
 *          Strings are heavily used as keys in HashMap, HashSet.
 *          If a string’s value could change, its hashCode() would also change → making it impossible to reliably retrieve values.*/
