For suppose we  have a class A - then

1. Static blocks and static variables in the order they are present in the class
    [Do not miss understand it - neither block nor variables comes first - purely depends on the order they are present]
2. Main method if triggered.
3. Constructor is called and executes firest line - implicit super() and then not the body of constructor and rather
4. Instance blocks and instance variable in the order they are present in the class
     [Do not miss understand it - neither block nor variables comes first - purely depends on the order they are present]
5. Constructor body is initialized after instance initializers.


Summary - in case of inheritance - when object of child triggered [A <-- B <-- C]

1. Parent static initializers in the order they are present in the class. [blocks and variables]
2. Child static initializers - in the order
3. Parent instance initializers - in the order they are present in class. [instance blocks and instance variables]
4. Child constructor first line triggered - implicit super() - goes to immediate parent constructor
5. Immediate parent constructor first line - implicit super() - goes to top parent constructor
6. Top parent constructor first line and then parent initializers[blocks and variables]
7.  so on.

Example summary in case of [A <-- B <-- C]
A - top parent
C - child
In test class we called C c = new C();

1. A’s static initializers (static variables and static blocks) in the order they appear in class A
2. B’s static initializers (static variables and static blocks) in the order they appear in class B
3. C static initializers (static variables and static blocks) in the order they appear in class C
4. C - constructor triggered - first line --> implicit super() --> goes to B() --> implicit first line  super() --> goes to A()
5. In A() (top-most constructor)--> first line is an implicit super() to Object().
6. After returning from Object(), A’s instance initializers (instance variables + instance blocks) run in the order they appear in A.
7. Then A’s constructor body executes and A() completes.
8. B Constructor takes the debugger --> first line super() completed so now
9. B instance initializers (instance variables + instance blocks) run in the order they appear in B.
10. B() completed
11. C() takes control
12. C’s instance initializers (instance variables + instance blocks) run in textual order in class C.
13, C() gets completed.
