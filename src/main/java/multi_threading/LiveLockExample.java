/*
* - Livelock is another concurrency problem and is similar to deadlock.
* - In livelock, two or more threads keep on transferring states between one another instead of waiting infinitely as we saw in the deadlock example.
* - Consequently, the threads are not able to perform their respective tasks.

*  A great example of livelock is a messaging system where, when an exception occurs,
*  the message consumer rolls back the transaction and puts the message back to the head of the queue.
*  Then the same message is repeatedly read from the queue, only to cause another exception and be put back on the queue.
*  The consumer will never pick up any other message from the queue.
