 * interrupt() method used to interrupt the existing thread

 * throw interrupted exception
 *
 * To have a meaningful work of interrupt() method , you have to combine it with isInterrupted() method
 * it checks the flag and returns true or false
 *
 * Based on that you can programmatically modify whatever you want*/
