    * Main difference is that when program calls start() method a new Thread is created and

    * while if you call run() method directly no new Thread is created and
    * code inside run() will execute on the current Thread.
    *
    *
    * Another difference between start vs run in Java thread is that
    *  you can not call start() method twice on the thread object.
    * once started, the second call of start() will throw IllegalStateException in Java
    * while you can call run() method twice.

* Runnable vs Thread
If your class provides more functionality rather than just running as Thread,
*  you should implement Runnable interface to provide a way to run it as Thread.
*  If your class only goal is to run as Thread, you can extend Thread class.
* Implementing Runnable is preferred because java supports implementing multiple interfaces.
* If you extend Thread class, you canâ€™t extend any other classes.*/
