🔴 A Marker Interface (also known as a tag interface) is an interface in Java that has no methods, fields, or constants.
   It is completely empty.
🔴 Sole purpose is to tag a class or interface or to group a certain classes in a single group

👀 Its usage became less after Java 5 because of introduction of Annotations in java

➡️ mainly works with keyword instanceOf

➡️ Eg: Serializable, Clonable, etc..


📣 common interview trap ⚠️

    ❓ Why not use annotations instead?

        ✔ Marker interfaces:

            1. Are part of the type system
            2. Can be used in generics
            3. <T extends Serializable>


        ❌ Annotations cannot do this

📣 Marker interface vs Annotation (VERY important)


| Marker Interface  | Annotation               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pre-Java 5        | Java 5+                  |
| Uses `instanceof` | Uses reflection          |
| Only for classes  | Classes, methods, fields |
| Cannot hold data  | Can hold values          |
