Interfaces evolution

From java 8 , Interfaces can have default and static methods which are used for reusing the concrete codes in child interfaces

From java 9, private methods are introduced in interfaces (private and private static)

            1. Reusability of code with in interfaces(preferably in default and static methods).
            2. We need not expose these private methods to child implementing classes.
