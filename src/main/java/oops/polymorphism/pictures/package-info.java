1. Please read about access specifiers and method overriding

In case of Method Overriding the access modifier can be same as declared in super class or can be of higher visibility.

2. please read about exception handling and method overriding

private Method cannot be Overridden , because it cannot be inherited.
Final method can be inherited but cannot be overridden.
The purpose of method overriding is to achieve Runtime Polymorphism.
Note: we can Overload main method , but we cannot override main method because it is static.

Rules for method overriding
       I. The return type of method must be same as declared in super class.
       (please read about co-varient return types in java)
      II. Method name must be same as declared in super class.
      III. Signature must be same as declared as in super class. Logic can be different.
      Note: we can optionally use an annotation @Override.
